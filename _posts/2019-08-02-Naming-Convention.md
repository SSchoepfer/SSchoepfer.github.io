_Naming Convention_

About Me: 
Administrative Education Analyst for the NYC Dept. of Education. 
I Currently serve as Data Manager for the Staten Island Borough Office. 
Right now I'm focused on attaining a Masters Degree in Database Systems from Touro College Grad School of Technology.

I staretd this blog in 2019. 
I always had an interest in writing and coding. 
I dabbled with wordpress and some other blog website services. I settled on github pages because it was simple yet complex, and has also been a learning opportunity. Creating this site made me brush up on things like html, and css while learning new things such as jekyll, markdown, javascript, python, and random other things. The idea of a static site appealed to me. I get to customize each piece of the site, while learning along the way. I planned on using the blog to write all about things in my life, but so far at the time of writing this (Jan 2020) I have used it mostly for learning Python for Data Science, and Jupyter notebooks specifically. This is a great platform to share Jupyter notebooks, a tool I plan on using for 'data storytelling'. I look forward to evolving this blog in 2020. Thanks for visiting! Please reach out to me on twitter @SteveSchoepfer if you'd like to chat about anything you see here.

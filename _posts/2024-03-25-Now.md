<span>Now Now Now</span>
<p><em><span>Updated April '24.</span></em><span> </span></p>  

Right now 

...I'm adding some musical ideas to this part of my [website][def] 

[def]: https://stephenschoepfer.com/cube/

My electronic music making setup right now consists of a Kaossilator Pro into a KP3 into an input on the Digitakt into a DJ mixer, which has a vintage reverb as a send/receive. All of that can be routed into a cassette tape mixer and then export to digital.

I have the clock syncing the DT and KP3    

<p><span>This is </span><a href='https://nownownow.com/about'><span>a now page</span></a><span>, inspired by </span><a href='https://sive.rs'><span>Derek Sivers</span></a><span>. If you have your own site, </span><a href='https://nownownow.com/about'><span>you should make one</span></a><span>, too.</span></p>

### What Happened at the Stew - Wednesday, June 10th 2019

Pre-Stew: Manhattan for DM meeting in the afternoon led to bonus time with brews and card games. (Exploding Kittens, Citadels) After the slightly buzzy 8p ferry ride I went over to the stew to meet Pasq, MZ & Jah.

All we did was jam! Marios on bass, Duddy on Guitar, I'm on Drums. 
Just like the olden days of the garage and 'Ullie Deuces' (10 years ago this July...) It was a nice ~warm~ hot July evening jam.
I have the Ableton session that Pasq recorded. I want to listen and upload chunks of it (or the whole thing) to add it to this post.

I was using the Tama burgundy kick, Ludwig snare w/ Dream FX, two sets of hats (Custom Dark K's on the left, Vintage New-Beats on the right) two floor toms (Slingerland, Zimgar) and the big boy 24" ride (Vintage Joey P Zildjian A)

<!-- # What Happened at the Studio - April 29th 2019 -->    
This is my idea for a series of blog posts: A quick write-up recapping whatever happened at the studio. Doing this will keep my musical projects on the top of mind and keep the momentum going and the ideas flowing (hopfully). I'm sure this will go through many edits and iterations as I continue to build out this website and start writing more about my personal and professional experiences. 

No matter how long or short the studio session was, and even if nothing particular was 'productive' or accomplished, I hope to log it here. Without further ado: Here is my first entry into the "What Happened at the Studio" series of posts. 

# April 29, 2019 
I got to the studio at around 11pm after a long day or traveling around Manhattan for work, grad school, and wedding preperations (I'm getting married in 4 days at the time of writing this) I was burnt out from the day and all I needed was a shower and sleep. However, Duddy was at the stew and I had to go drop something off that I borrowed from him. The stew was calling. I took some time to straighten up from leaving abruptly during my last session. Then Duddy and I began to jam. There was one microphone to the left side ofthe drum set, near the Zildjian K hi-hats. I had the 'Dream' FX cymbal on the 14" Ludwig Acrolite. This Dream cymbal gives my snare drum a sound I love. It Muffles the head for a nice thuid, yet you still get the "thwack" and the jingle from the effect cymbal. 
Anyway, I zoned out and as Duddy and I started jamming, my mind wandered from all the wedding planning, grad school, work life, and other daily stressors. I felt that feeling of being completely saturated in the sounds and the jam. Dud's was rocking out on a looper pedal and going crazy with loops and playing them in reverse for a psychadelic vibe. We ended up jamming over things that called to mind ideas that we jammed on in years past. Duddy's song "Glitch Face" came up in the jam organically, I felt emotional a I hadnt jammes along to that one in so long, and this tune brought back memories.

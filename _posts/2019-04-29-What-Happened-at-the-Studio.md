<!-- # What Happened at the Studio - April 29th 2019 -->

### Idea: Running journal of studio sessions   

Doing this will keep my momentum up on musical projects, and help me to gain clarity, in a musical and creative sense. I hope to log **every** session here, regardless of duration or 'productivity' of the session. I'm sure this will go through plenty of edits as I continue to build on this site and write more. Below is my first entry into the "What Happened at the Studio" series.

# April 29, 2019 
I got to the studio at around 11pm after a long day or traveling around Manhattan for work, grad school, and wedding preperations (I'm getting married in 4 days at the time of writing this) 
I was burnt out from the day and all I needed was sleep. However, Duddy was at the stew so took a walk over there. 
I took some time to straighten up the drum-area, I left it pretty sloppy after my last session, cables everywhere. 
Duddy and I jammed, guitar and drums. There was one microphone to the left side of the drums, near the 'K' hats, and one near Duds' amp. I had the Dream FX cymbal on the 14" Ludwig Acrolite snare. This Dream FX cymbal gives the snare drum a nice sound. It Muffles the head for a nice thud, and you get the cool jingle effect.   
As we started playing, my mind wandered and felt clear. I wasnt thinking about any plans, school or work. Nice. 
Duds' was rocking the green Line 6 pedal and going wild with loops and playing them in reverse, it made for a psychadelic vibe. I was building up the four to the floor beat, with plenty of space to experiment with the hats on the left and right side. The two hat sounds with the Dream Fx snare cymbal made for a nice sounding kit, I even added another small tambo on the right side hats for even more jingle.  
We ended up playing a tune called "Glitch Face" which we used to play some years back, brought back memories. I put up the 24" ride cymbal and played that for a a few minutes. That thing sounds great. I love a minimal setup with muted sounds, but there is something so amazing about the 24" ride (the one I got from Joe Piazza) 

### Conclusion 
A short, late-night session with Duddy turned into a good bout of nostalgia, stress relief, and good vibes to end a crazy Monday.

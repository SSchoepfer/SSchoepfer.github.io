<!-- # What Happened at the Studio - April 29th 2019 -->

### Idea: a running journal of studio sessions   

Doing this will keep my momentum up on musical projects, and help me to gain clarity, in a musical and creative sense. I hope to log **every** session here, regardless of duration or 'productivity' of the session. I'm sure this will go through plenty of edits as I continue to build on this site and write more. Below is my first entry into the "What Happened at the Studio" series.

# April 29, 2019 
I got to the studio at around 11pm after a long day or traveling around Manhattan for work, grad school, and wedding preperations (I'm getting married in 4 days at the time of writing this) 
I was burnt out from the day and all I needed was sleep. However, Duddy was at the stew so took a walk over there. 
I took some time to straighten up the drum-area, I left it pretty sloppy after my last session, cables everywhere. 
Duddy and I jammed, guitar and drums. There was one microphone to the left side of the drums, near the 'K' hats, and one near Duds' amp. I had the Dream FX cymbal on the 14" Ludwig Acrolite snare. This Dream FX cymbal gives the snare drum a nice sound. It Muffles the head for a nice thud, and you get the cool jingle effect.   
As Duddy and I started jamming, my mind wandered and felt very clear and aware, almost giddy. I wasnt thinking about any of the wedding plans, grad school or professional workload or any other stressors. 
I felt completely 'in the moment' and saturated in the sounds of the jam. 
Duds' was rocking a looper pedal and going wild with loops and playing them in reverse, it made for a psychadelic vibe. I was building up the four-floor beats, but had plenty of space to experiment with the hi-hats on the left and right side, while juxtaposing those two hat sounds with the Dream Fx snare cymbal.   
We ended up playing a sound that called to mind Duddy's song "Glitch Face" which we used to play 5-6 years ago.  
It came up in the jam organically, and felt great and natural. This tune brought back memories, I hope to jam on Glitch Face sometime again soon. I then put up the 24" ride cymbal and rocked out on that for a little. That thing sounds so good! I love a minimal setup with muted sounds, but there is something so amazing about the 24" ride that I got from Joe Piazza. 

### Conclusion 
A short, late-night session with Duddy turned into a good bout of nostalgia, stress relief, and good vibes to end a crazy Monday.

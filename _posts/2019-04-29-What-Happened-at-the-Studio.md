# What Happened at the Studio - April 29th 2019   
This is my idea for a series of blog posts: A recap of what happened at the studio on any particular day. Doing this will keep my musical projects on the top of mind and keep the momentum going and the ideas flowing. I'm sure this idea will go through many edits and iterations as I continue to build out this website and start writing more about my personal and professional experiences. 

No matter how long or short the studio session was, and even if nothing particular was productive or accomplished, I hope to log it here. Without further ado: Here is my first entry into the "What Happened at the Studio" series of posts.

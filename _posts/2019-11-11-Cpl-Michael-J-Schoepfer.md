"Transcending the Ultimate Barriers of Time and Space" is a phrase on a book my cousin Michael gave to me. 
We bonded over this book for years. When our relationship was distant, we would always come back to eachother and bond over the "Shen Ku", sharing what pages we were currently delving into. 

If we hadnt spoken for a while, we'd text or call and our conversations would always be about our "Shen Ku" studies. We would always joke around about our lifelong pursuit to become a "Shen Ku" master.   

He changed my life.

When he gave me his copy of 'The Art of Shen Ku' when I was very young, I immediately knew this would be one of my favorite books ever, but never knew how practical that quote would be.

I never realized how this quote would be resonating with me so fully in my life, until Michaels death. 
This phrase has been replaying in my mind whenever I think about him.

Corporal Michael J Schoepfer was the smartest, strongest, most kind person in my life, ever. He would always be ready to teach me something, lend me a book, tell a funny story, or share some music that he was into. 

Here he is in Afghanistan in October of 2010, being a bad-ass American hero during Operation Enduring Freeedom.

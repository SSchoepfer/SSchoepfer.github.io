Rest in Peace Corporal Michael J Schoepfer, United States Marine Corps Hero, my cousin.  

Here he is in Afghanistan in October of 2010, being a bad-ass American hero during Operation Enduring Freeedom.

4 months before this photo was taken, his performance on the battlefield earned him the 'Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal' for: 

PROFESSIONAL ACHIEVEMENT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTIES WHILE SERVING AS SQUAD AUTOMATIC RIFLEMAN, 3RD SQUAD, 1ST PLATOON, BATTERY 1,  3/2 1ST BATTLION, 11TH MARINES, RECIMENTAL COMBAT TEAM 2, 1ST MARINE DIVISION FORWARD, IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM IN HELMAND PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN. 


CPL SCHOEPFER DEMONSTRATED TREMENDOUS VERSATILITY WHILE SERVING IN A PROVISIONAL INFANTRY MISSION. 
ON 5 JULY 2010, HE ENGAGED THE ENEMY AT OVER 1500 METERS WITH MEDIUM AND HEAVY MACHINE GUNS, AND ADJUSTED THE PLACEMENT OF 81MM ILLUMINATION AND HIGH EXPLOSIVE MORTAR ROUNDS, WHICH ULTIMATELY LEAD TO 2 ENEMY KILLED IN ACTION AND 2 WOUNDED IN ACTION, TO INCLUDE A TALIBAN COMMANDER. 

CPL SCHOEPFER WAS ONE OF ONLY EIGHT MARINES IN THE BATTERY TO QUALIFY IN THE USE OF THE 81MM MORTAR SYSTEM.

HIS PROFICIENCY IN AN ADDITIONAL SPECIALTY FIELD ALLOWED HIM TO ENGAGE THE ENEMY WITH OVER 10 HE ROUNDS AND OVER 70 ILLUMINATION ROUNDS IN SUPPORT OF BATTERY PATROLS, COUNTER IED OPERATIONS, AND JOINT OPERATIONS WITH THE AFGHANISTAN UNIFORMED POLICE. 

CPL SCHOEPFER'S INITIATIVE, PERSEVERANCE AND TOTAL DEDICATION TO DUTY REFLECTED CREDIT UPON HIM AND WERE IN KEEPING WITH THE HIGHEST TRADITIONS OF THE MARINE CORPS AND THE UNITED STATES NAVAL SERVICE. 




When the shock of losing my cousin wore off a bit, all I could think of is a quote from a book he once gave me: "Transcending the Ultimate Barriers of Time and Space"

This is a phrase on "The Art of Shen Ku" by Zeek.  
We bonded over this book for years. 
When our relationship grew distant, we would always end up talking to eachother about the "Shen Ku". 
We'd share our favorite pages and compare our experiences with implementing the wisdom held within. 

Our conversations would always revolve around our "Shen Ku" studies. 
We would always joke around about our lifelong pursuit of becoming a "Shen Ku" master.   

MJ's impact on me was huge. He was my cooler older cousin, and when he showed me music or books that he was into, I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I immediately knew this Shen Ku would be one of my favorite books. It is, and always will be. 

Although he had a troubled childhood, MJ was the smartest, bravest, most kind person in my life.
He would always be ready to teach me something, tell a funny story, or share some music that he would know I'd enjoy.

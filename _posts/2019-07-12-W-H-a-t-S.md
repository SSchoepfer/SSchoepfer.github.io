### What Happened at the Stew - Friday, June 12th 2019
Walked in, played some solo drums.
Practiced with Joey P. 
Few coldies because Friday. 
Chopped it up with Joey on the pads, then on all 3 classic kits.  
Gretsch, Sonor, Ludwig, all decked out with the rarest cymbals...  All such beautiful sounding and unique sets. 
Hope to keep learning from JP.

  - Thoughts: I need to be more patient in the paint while going against defenders that are of my height (or taller) or with a equal or greater level of athleticism. Need to utilize quickness against bigger bodied defenders. Work on 'stopping on a dime', making a few pivots, pump fakes (if the situation calls for it) & being unpredictable.

  - Thoughts: I need to be more patient in the paint while going against defenders that are of my height (or taller) or with a equal or greater level of athleticism. Need to utilize quickness against bigger bodied defenders. Work on 'stopping on a dime', making a few pivots, pump fakes (if the situation calls for it) & being unpredictable.  
- • Thu July 11th, BBall @ CSI
  - I missed way to many layups. Right shoulder hurts a bit when lifting and moving it around / to the left. I'm pretty sure this is from trying to dunk, which I dont have the technique down for.
- • Sat July 13th, ~3m jog @ Silver Lake
  - Walked from Navy Pier, thru Hero Park, stretched in Silver Lake for a while, tried to stay in shade and on hilly areas and just mindful of form. Stretched again after 3 miles then walked back.
- Mon July 15th, ~2m bike ride from Navy Pier -> USPS in the ferry terminal and back, pre-work.

Running List: 

* Sat June 29th BBall tourney @ House of Sports
  * A Nested List Item
* Sun June 30th PhilUSA Playoffs vs. 'Green'
  * Another Nested Item
* Mon July 1st [Yoga](https://www.instagram.com/tvyogi)

* This is a list
  * Sub item 1
  * Sub item 2

* Next list item. We can also nest code:

      def foo
        "hello!"
      end

  ... and continue writing. This still is part of the list item.


Also works for definition lists, but is tricky.
: ^

  * Foo
  * Bar
  
  Still part of the definition description.

This past Saturday ['The Mathemagician'](https://music.nemirex.co/) performed at the SI art space for this months 'Sleepy Droner Club'.

The night started with an experimental electronic set by Rory & AJ, which included an amplified, metal, musical "tree" that makes distorted wind-chime-esque sounds when hit with a mallet. Those sounds were then sent to outer-space and back by an effect processing unit.

The Mathemagician, appearing as a bass and guitar duo with plenty of effect chains, summoned a noise-rock-distorted-groovy-dissonant-jam-filled set. I recorded it using [Smart Recorder Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrwq.recorder&hl=en_US) on a Google Pixel 2 XL. I used Adobe Audition to change the .wav file into an .mp3 (no plugins) and am now hosting the .mp3 file here on this blog.

'Amawalk' closed out the night with a deep-bass set, slightly reminiscent of Shpongle, which is a big compliment, as I'm a fan of Shpongle.

This past Saturday ['The Mathemagician'](https://music.nemirex.co/) performed at the SI art space for this months 'Sleepy Droner Club'.

The night started with an awesome electronic, experimental tunes by Rory & AJ, which included a metal, musical tree that that made distorted wind-chime-esque sounds that were then manipulated by effect processors.

The Mathemagician, appearing as a bass and guitar duo with plenty of effect chains, summoned a noise-rock-distorted-groovy-yet-dissonant jam filled set.

'Amawalk' closed out the night with a deep-bass set reminiscent of something you'd hear at a Shpongle show, which is a big compliment, as I'm a huge fan of Shpongle.

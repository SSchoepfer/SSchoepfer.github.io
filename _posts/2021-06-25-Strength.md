This is my guideline for a 7 day strength training program. 

It follows three different programs from two books.    

The books are 'The Art of Shen Ku' by Zeek, and 'Ready to Run' by Dr. Kelly Starrett.

'No Equip' and 'Sculpt' come from Zeek and 'Ready to Run' is the sample week of movement and mobility work from pages 268 and 269 in @TheReadyState's book.

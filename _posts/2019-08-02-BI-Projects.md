In this post I'll collect all of the public reports I made with Power BI, and give a rundown on the ideas and methods. 

I installed 'Power BI Desktop' on my work PC at the end of January 2018. Since this was the 'new wave' for Excel nerds like myself, I wasted no time designing reports to share with colleagues. I had a 'workspace' on Office 365 that worked with the desktop app. I would create reports on the desktop app and then push them to the Office 365 space, where I could share them publically. It was a bit clunky, but working well. I had to publish everything publicly in order to share them efficiently as a hyperlink, colleagues didnt have PBI licenses at the time. 

Things got lost when I had the central technology department start a Sharepoint group with the same name as my PBI workspace, so I lost all of the 'workspace' things that were pushed from desktop to O365. Not a huge deal, because the things I had created were still saved as .pbix files on my desktop, and the published reports were still live via the public links.

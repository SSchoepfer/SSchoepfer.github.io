## A New Post 

Writing a blog post on [my site](sschoepfer.github.io) using the site
prose.io

Wondering if this is a good tool to use for writing on the go. Not sure if i can edit metadata and front matter from this site. 

Enter text in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Use the toolbar above, or click the **?** button for formatting help.

## A New Post 

Writing and publishing a blog post on [my site](sschoepfer.github.io) using 
[prose.io](prose.io) from an Android phone. 

Hoping this is a good tool to use for writing on the go. I can edit posts and metadata (front matter) from this site, and set postings published setting to true, meaning publishing blog posts from anywhere. The text editor on Chrome for Android doesn't seem too bad. Less buggy than the first time I tried this tool. Before using it, you need to authorize on Github. 

Enter text in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Use the toolbar above, or click the **?** button for formatting help.

The cursor keeps jumping around. 

Not sure if its a keyboard issue, or just an issue with Prose.io on my Pixel2XL. Will look into that now. 

At least I can confirm that publishing posts works just fine.

### Background
From around 2011-2012 I was in pretty bad shape. I had done damage to my body, specifically my back. This was caused by inactivity, and sitting too much. I lived in Staten Island and worked in Brooklyn. Every weekday I would sit down for an hour+ bus ride, get to Manhattan, then take a short train ride to Downtown Brooklyn. I'd reach my desk-job and sit for most of the day. On normal weekdays I would hop right back on the train and bus and sit down again, sometimes falling asleep on the bus in weird positions, waking up in a substancial amount of pain. 
 
It came to a boiling point and I had to do something. I started going to a chiropractor, who suggested the Graston technique. This is a process where he used scary looking metal tools to intentionally bruise my back muscles. It worked. When the muscle and tissue healed, it had healed 'correctly', and the acute pain was significantly lessened. This seemed like an extreme measure for a twenty-something guy who was athletic for most of my life. 
  
I knew I had to change my lifestyle to make sure the pains wouldn’t return. I was on a mission to learn to avoid the lower back, hip, neck pain, improve my physique and posture, and live a pain free life. 
  
I started prioritizing exercise again, but my habits and routines weren’t consistent enough. Pain and tightness crept back into my life. I would stave it off temporarily, but it was consistently creeping back in. I knew I didn’t want to turn to a chiropractor again, because it seemed extreme. I would troll YouTube for physical therapy videos (Bob and Brad FTW). I learned a lot about how to respond to aches and pains. This helped, but it was more like a short-term fix, the tightness and pain weren’t gone completely, It was like a game of injury ‘whack-a-mole’. Very reactive. Not good. 

Fast forward to 2017 and I still wasn’t actively staying in good pain free flexible shape. I would play a few pickup games of basketball once or twice a week, usually with little or no warmup. The mornings after basketball games would range from mild to excruciating, but low-back tightness and pain was way too common. I had to change again. Enter Yoga.

My then girlfriend (now wife) introduced me to my first yoga class around 2014 at 'Yoga to the People' on St Marks. We would go to this donation-based studio because it was a healthy, cheap alternative to a traditional date. I could tell how this was a great heallthy challenging, but it never stuck as a routine because of the nature of my life at the time (living in Staten, Working in Brooklyn) Fast forward to late 2017, 2018 and I'm living at a new apartment building in Staten Island (Urby) (Urby mega-post is something I plan on writing within the next year, as my 4th year as a Urby tenant will be coming to a close) 

This is where I met TVYogi and EVERYTHING has changed since...

### Background
 In 2012 I was in bad shape. I had done damage to my body, specifically my back, caused by inactivity, weakness, sitting too much. I lived in Staten Island and worked in Brooklyn. This means I would sit down for about an hour bus ride every morning, get to Manhattan, then a short train ride to BK. I'd reach my desk-job and sit for most of the day. On normal days I would hop right back on the train and bus and sit down again, sometimes falling asleep on the bus in weird positions. 
 
  It came to a boiling point and I had to do something. I started going to a chiropractor, and he suggested the Graston technique. This is a process where he used scary looking metal tools to intentionally bruise my back muscles. It worked. When the muslce and tissue healed, it had healed 'correctly', and the acute pain was significantly lessened. This seemed like an extreme measure for a young man who was athletic for most of my life. 
  
  I knew I had to change my lifestyle to make sure the pains wouldnt return. I was on a mission to learn to avoid the lower back, hip, neck pain, improve my physique and posture, and live a pain free life. 
  
  I started prioritizing exercise again, but my habits and routines werent consistent enough. Pain and tightness crept back into my life. I would stave it off temporarily, but it was consistently creeping back in. I knew I didnt want to turn to a chiropractor again, because it seemed extreme. I would troll youtube for physical therapy videos (Bob and Brad FTW). I learned a lot about how to respond to aches and pains. This helped, but it was more like a short term fix, the tightness and pain wasnt gone completely, It was like a game of . 
Fast forward to 2017 and I still wasnt pro-actively staying in good pain free flexible shape. I would play a few pickup gamnes of basketball once or twice a week, usually with little or no warming up. The mornings after the basketball games would range from mild to excruciating, but low-back tightness and pain was way too common. I had to change again. 
Enter Yoga.

  My girlfriend (now wife) introduced me to my first yoga class around 2014 at 'Yoga to the People' on St Marks. We would go to this donation based studio because it was a healthy, cheap alternative to a traditional date at a coffee shop, bar, theatre. I could tell how this was a great challenging practice, but it never stuck as a routine because of the nature of my life at the time (living in Staten, Working in Brooklyn) Fast forward to late 2017, 2018 and I'm living at a place called Urby (Urby mega-post is somethng I plan on writing within the next year, as my 4th year as a tennant there will be coming to a close) Anyway. This is where i met TVYogi and EVERYTHING has changed since.

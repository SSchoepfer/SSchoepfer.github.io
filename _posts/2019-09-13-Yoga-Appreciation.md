In 2012 I was in bad shape. I had done damage to my body, specifically my back, caused by inactivity, weakness, sitting too much. I lived in Staten Island and worked in Brooklyn. This means I would sit down for about an hour bus ride every morning, get to Manhattan, then a short train ride to Bk, then I'd reach my desk job and sit for most of the day. On normal days I would hop right back on the train and bus and sit down again, sometimes falling asleep on the bus in weird positions. It came to a boiling point and I had to do something. I started going to a chiropractor and he suggested the Graston technique, where he used metal tools to intentionally bruise my back muscles. This actually worked, because when the muslce and tissue healed, it had healed 'correctly', the acute pain lessened significantly. This seemed like an extreme measure for a young guy who was athletic for my whole life. I had to change my lifestyle so this pain wouldnt return. I was on a mission to learn to avoid the lower back, hip, neck pain again.
I started prioritizing exercise again. But my habits werent exactly a consistent routine. Pain and tightness crept back into my life and I would stave it off temporarily, but it was always creeping back in. I knew I didnt want to turn to a chiropractor again, because it seemed extreme. I would troll youtube for physical therapy videos (Bob and Brad for the win) and I learned a lot about how to respond to aches and pains. This helped, but it was also sort of a stop-gap, where I would feel better, but the tightness and pain wasnt gone completely. I was just mostly being reactive to painful situations. Not proactively staying ingood flexible shape. 
Fast forward to 2017.
